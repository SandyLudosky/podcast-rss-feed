  summary:
    "Susan B. Anthony's speech was delivered in 1873, during her defense in court after being arrested for casting an illegal vote in the 1872 presidential election. In her speech, Anthony argues that her action was not a crime but rather an exercise of her rights as a United States citizen, as guaranteed by the Constitution. She emphasizes that the Constitution was formed by \"we the people,\" which includes women, and that denying women the right to vote goes against the principles of democracy and liberty. Anthony argues that any state law that discriminates against women's voting rights is null and void, just like laws discriminating against African Americans.",
